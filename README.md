# terminal
Features I'd like to have in terminal which could help me proceed with my day-to-day routines

- history
- commands statistics
- hints (based on history or dir content)
- commands usage timing
- open terminal after reboot on the same folders (remember pwd states)
- run frequently used commands with hotkeys (example command name is `hk`)
```
hk git
git add . (1)
git commit -a (2)
...
```
